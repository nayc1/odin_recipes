            <h2>Scallop Fried Rice with XO sauce and Garlic chips</h2>
                <p>Scallop fried rice is a tasty rendition on the tradional chinese fried rice dish. Often times scallop fried rice uses dried scallops but in this recipe we wil be using fresh scallops and XO sauce to add harder hitting flavors and spice to the dish. It will also be using crispy garlic chips to add more texture to the dish and add more flavors and depth. This dish isnt as healthy as the classic dried scallop egg fried rice but it will surely be a tasty meal for all to enjoy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
                <li>1 pound of Bay scallops</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Shaoxing wing</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 medium onion</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of scallop XO sauce</li>
                <li>Salt(to taste)</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon of ground white pepper</li>
                <li>1 chopped scallion</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat your wok until it just begins to smoke and add 1 tablespoon oil. Throw in the scallops and sear (without moving them) 60 seconds until they get some good color. Toss them around until they're just opaque and set aside on a plate. Beat the eggs with shaoxing wine and salt and set aside.</li>
                <li>Wash and dry your wok and heat it over low heat, with 2 tablespoons oil. Add the garlic and spread it around evenly. Let the garlic fry very slowly until they just turn golden. If it goes brown, it's already burned and bitter, so keep a constant watch on it! It should take about 5 minutes for the garlic to get crispy and just start to turn light golden. When they are ready, transfer the crispy garlic to a paper towel to drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Leave the infused oil from the garlic in the wok, and raise the heat to medium high. Add the diced onions and stir-fry until translucent. Add in the rice to the onion mixture, and then pour the egg mixture evenly over all the rice. Immediately begin stirring constantly in a scoop and lift motion. This will leave all your rice coated in a thin layer of scrambled egg. After about 90 seconds of stirring, mix in the XO sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and then add in the scallops and scallion. Toss for 30 seconds and serve with the fried garlic sprinkled over the top!</li>
