            <h2>
                <p>Scallop fried rice is a tasty rendition on the tradional chinese fried rice dish. Often times scallop fried rice uses dried scallops but in this recipe we wil be using fresh scallops and XO sauce to add harder hitting flavors and spice to the dish. It will also be using crispy garlic chips to add more texture to the dish and add more flavors and depth. This dish isnt as healthy as the classic dried scallop egg fried rice but it will surely be a tasty meal for all to enjoy.</p>
